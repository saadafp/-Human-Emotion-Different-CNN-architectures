Human emotion detection is one of computer vision tasks which I want to work on it in this notebook.

Human emotion detection in computer vision involves the analysis of facial expressions to recognize and understand human emotions. 
This area of research is essential for applications in human-computer interaction, sentiment analysis, personalized systems, and mental health assessment. 
Using computer vision techniques, it is possible to infer emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and more from facial cues.
